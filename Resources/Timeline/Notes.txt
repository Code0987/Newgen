     - HTML5 packages (i.e. node-webkit based)
     - Folder based custom packages (i.e. use any folder as a package)
          - Support for PortableApps.com app folder
          - Support for selecting main launcher file (.exe, .lnk, ...)
          - Monitor running apps launched under newgen.

Package installer
     Example: 
          In cmd-line version, pm get AECCP would download latest pirated & portable Adobe After Effects package from authors' web.
          The package can be downloaded as without pm using users' download manager and then put into pm, like
          pm get AECCP --data-at=<location>, in this mode it would download only package definition and use provided location for data. 

Launchy like launcher.

Re-integrate package/widgets with new HTML5 node-webkit runner support.
Optimize memory resources.

Re-design package metadata to user 'package.json' like file for metadata, so that Newgen can index and integrate non-newgen packages, also list them as link to launch a cmd to that package folder with appropriate package manager like nuget, npm, ...

Finish Settings layout.

Re-design Store - List all indexded packages, like in evernote cards style.
Provide update support.

OnMove [Feature]
     This would pack selected packages (like most used recently) into a USB/Removable drive, so they can be used while on move.
     Then later when move is over, Newgen/Extension would automatically determine that, on connecting same drive again and sync back all the changes done while on move and then flush the drive.

Instead of providing web-browser, first use user's choice of browser (chrome, firefox, ...) through plugins/extensions, hooks or crooks.

Package that can sync music in phone and newgen windows
